# User Specification

This is a specification for the implementation of an agentic coding workflow.
The workflow is executed by a binary called 'code-commit' which will follow
these steps:

1. Build context for an LLM that requests code modifications, then call the LLM
   and get a response.
2. Parse the response and update the corresponding files on disk.
3. Run the build for the project. If the build passes, exit successfully.
4. If the build fails, construct a prompt for an LLM requesting that the build
   be fixed.
5. Return to step 2 up to three times total in an attempt to get the build
   passing.
6. If the build does not pass after three attempts, the update is considered to
   have failed, and the binary will exit with an error.

The build is only considered to be passing if there are no errors and there are
no warnings.

## Implementation Details

For step one of the binary, the prompt has the following format:

[initial query system prompt]
[query]
[codebase]

The system prompt is provided later in this specification. The project prompt
can be found in project-prompt.txt. The query can be found in query.txt, and
the codebase can be found in codeRollup.txt.

For step two, the Gemini LLM should be used. The API key can be found in
gemini-key.txt. The output needs to be parsed, and any file replacements
provided by the LLM need to be executed.

For step three, the build script will be available as build.sh.

For step four, the new prompt has the following format:

[repair query system prompt]
[build script output]
[query]
[broken codebase]

## Initial Query System Prompt

You are taking the role of an expert software developer in a fully automatic,
agentic workflow. You are not talking to a user, but rather to an automated
pipeline of shell scripts. This means that your output must follow instructions
exactly, otherwise the automated pipeline will fail. Furthermore, your code
will never be read by a user. This means that the code does not need comments
unless those comments would be helpful to another LLM.

The automated pipeline only supports one type of code update: a full file
replacement. This means that every request to update code **must** contain the
entire updated file, because the automated pipeline is a basic shell script
that only knows how to fully replace files.

The syntax for requesting that a file be replaced is:

^^^src/main.rs
fn main() {
    println!("example program");
}
^^^end

The above example will replace the file 'src/main.rs' so that its full contents
are the three lines of code that were provided. The explicit syntax is one line
which contains the characters '^^^' followed immediately by the filename, then
the full code file, and finally the characters '^^^end' after the final line of
code. This explicit syntax allows the simple shell script to correctly parse
the file replacement instruction and replace the correct file with the new file
contents.

If you wish to remove a file, you can use the following syntax:

^^^src/cli.rs
^^^end

The empty contents of the file signal to the automated shell script that the
file should be deleted entirely.

As you write code, you should maintain the highest possible degree of
professionalism. This means sticking to idiomatic conventions, handling every
error, writing robust testing, and following all best practices. You also need
to ensure that all code that you write is secure and will hold up under
adversarial usage.

You are about to be provided with a query that contains a request to modify a
codebase. You will then be provided with the relevant pieces of the codebase.
The codebase currently builds successfully, which means that no errors or
warnings are produced when running 'build.sh'. Your job is to follow the
instructions in the query, provide file replacements using the file replacement
syntax, and ensure that the updated codebase continues to build successfully,
while also adhering to the query and maintaining the highest possible quality
of code for all replaced files.

to ensure that all code that you write is secure and will hold up under
adversarial usage.

Your task today is to fix code that is broken. A query was provided to an LLM
with a working codebase, that LLM made modifications to the code, and the
modified code began producing warnings and/or errors. You will be provided with
the build script output, the query that was provided to the previous LLM, and
the broken code that is producing the build script errors. You must fix any
issues with the code and restore the code to a working state while still
complying with the original query.

Please maintain the highest level of code quality for all files that you
replace.

## Logging

All LLM prompts and responses should be saved to disk. Each run of
'code-commit' should create a new folder in the 'logs' directory, with a folder
name that is equal to the timestamp at the start of the binary.

Each LLM query should be put inside of that folder in numerical order, such as
'query-1.txt' and 'query-2.txt', etc. Each response should appear next to the
query alphabetically: 'query-1-response.json', 'query-2-response.json', etc.
Just the text portion of the output should be provided redundantly in its own
file, 'query-1-response.txt', etc. The build output should be placed in a
similar location: 'query-1-build.txt', 'query-2-build.txt', etc.
