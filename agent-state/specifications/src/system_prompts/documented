# System Prompts

The system_prompts module contains constants which define different components
of a system prompt that can be passed into an LLM. Most agentic workflows use
some combination of system prompt constants from this module when composing
their own system prompts.

The system prompts are all text files that have already been created by the
supervisor. The LLM is to update mod.rs so that it contains constants which
load the files at compilation and share a name with the filename of the .txt
file. Every .txt file in this folder should have a corresponding constant in
mod.rs

It can be assumed that all prompts which are required by other modules have
already been created by the supervisor and will be loaded correctly upon
implementation.
