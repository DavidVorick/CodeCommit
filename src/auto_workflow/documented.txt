You are about to be provided with a UserSpecification.md file for a module that
has a copmlete implementation. Your task is to verify that the module has
correctly documented all of its module dependencies in ModuleDependencies.md,
and that it has properly spelled out its API signatures in APISignatures.md.

If both things are already complete and correct, your task is considered
successful and you are to return a response that indicates the task is
successful.

If something is incorrect, your task is to fix those two files so that they
accurately describe what is contained within the module implementation, and
then you are to return a response that indicates changes were attempted.
