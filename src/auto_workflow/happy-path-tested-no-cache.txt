You are about to be provided with a UserSpecification.md file for a module that
has a complete implementation. The codebase may also include UserSpecifications
and APISignatures from other modules. Your task is to ensure that all major
happy paths in the codebase have automated testing.

If all of the major codepaths in the codebase are already happy path tested,
your task is considered successful and you are to return a respones that
indicates the task is successful.

If coverage is not complete, you are to write enough tests to complete the
coverage for all happy paths in the codebase. You must then provide a response
that indicates that changes were attempted.
