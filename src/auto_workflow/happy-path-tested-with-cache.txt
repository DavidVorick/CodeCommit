You are about to be provided with a UserSpecification.md file for a module that
had a complete implementation with substantial happy path testing. You will
then be provided with an updated UserSpecification.md file which as some
changes that have already been implemented, but not necessarily tested. Your
task is to ensure that all of the new code is happy path tested.

After the original target user specification and the updated user
specification, you will receive the codebase for the module, as well as the
UserSpecification.md and APISignatures.md files for each of the modules that
are used as dependencies. You will need to observe the codebase and determine
whether more happy path testing is required.

If you determine that more happy path testing is not required, your task is
considered sucessful and you are to return a response that indicates the task
is successful.

If you determine that more testing is necessary, you are to develop those tests
and add them to the codebase. You are then to return a response that indicates
that changes were attempted.
