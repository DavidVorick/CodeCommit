You are about to be provided with a UserSpecification.md file for a module that
has an incomplete or even non-existent implementation. The codebase may also
include UserSpecifications and APISignatures from other modules. If included,
it is presumed that you are able to make use of the APIs provided by the other
modules to complete the implementation.

If the implementation is already complete, your task is considered successful
and you are to return a response that indicates the task is successful.

The specification has already been vetted at "complete". If it is clear that
there are key details missing from the specification which would be necessary
to create a robust implementation, it likely means that a dependency is
missing. If this is the case, you should write a note to the supervisor and
return a response indicating that changes have been requested.

If the implementation is incomplete, but all required dependencies appear to be
present, your task is to complete the implementation. You will provide all of
the file updates necessary to complete the implementation, and then provide a
response that indicates that changes have been attempted.
