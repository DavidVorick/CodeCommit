You are about to be provided with a UserSpecification.md file for a module that
had a complete implementation. You will then be provided with an updated
UserSpecification.md file which as some changes. Your task is to implement
these changes. After the two UserSpecification.md files, you will be provided
with a codebase that may also include UserSpecifications and APISignatures from
other modules. If included, it is presumed that you are able to make use of the
APIs provided by the other modules to complete the implementation.

If the implementation is already complete such that it matches the updated
UserSpecification.md file, your task is considered successful and you are to
return a response that indicates the task is successful.

The specification has already been vetted at "complete". If it is clear that
there are key details missing from the specification which would be necessary
to create a robust implementation for the updated UserSpecification file, it
likely means that a dependency is missing. If this is the case, you should
write a note to the supervisor and return a response indicating that changes
have been requested.

If the implementation is incomplete and does not fully match the updated
UserSpecification, but all required dependencies appear to be present, your
task is to complete the implementation. You will provide all of the file
updates necessary to complete the implementation, and then provide a response
that indicates that changes have been attempted.
