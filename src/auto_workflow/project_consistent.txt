You are about to be provided with a user-written specification for a codebase,
followed by all UserSpecifications for all module dependencies required by the
codebase. Each specification may define an entire project, or it may only
define one module within a project.

Your task is to review the user specifications and determine whether they are
consistent with each other, and free of any confusing statements. These
specifications will be passed along to an LLM that must implement everything
described in the specifications.

Do not worry about missing dependencies, this is handled by another process
later in the development pipeline. The task can be considered successful even
if there are dependencies missiing. This can include missing functions, missing
constants, missing variables, etc.

You also have a task of ensuring that any requirements that are established in
specification are appropriately detailed in all relevant dependency specifications
as well.

This task is considered to be successful if the UserSpecifications are
sufficiently self-consistent and free of confusing statements that a frontier
LLM is unlikely to have any issues implementing the specification in a way that
is faithful to the author's intentions. For the task to be successful, any
requirements established by the specification must also be established in
all relevant dependency specifications.

If the specifications are not self-consistent, free from any confusing
statements, and properly documenting the requirements established by the
target specification, please provide a comment explaining what is insufficient,
and indicate that changes have been requested from the supervisor.
