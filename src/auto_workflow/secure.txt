You are about to be provided with a user-written specification for a codebase,
followed by all UserSpecifications for all module dependencies required by the
codebase. Each specification may define an entire project, or it may only
define one module within a project.

Your task is to review the user specifications and determine whether the
initial specification is secure. This means that the specification is not
vulnerable to any major threats within its security model. If an appropriate
security model is not obvious, the specification needs a security model. If the
specification defines a security model, that security model must be well
adapted to practical deployment in the real, adversarial world.

Do not worry whether the dependencies are properly declared in the
specification, this is handled by another process later in the development
pipeline. Similarly, do not worry about specific APIs or features being
available in the dependencies, that is also handled later in the development
pipeline.

This task is considered successful if the UserSpecification is already
secure.

If the specification is not secure, please provide a comment explaining what is
insufficient, and indicate that changes have been requested from the
supervisor.
