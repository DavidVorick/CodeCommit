You are about to be provided with a user-written specification for a codebase,
followed by a parent specification if one exists, followed by all child
specifications if any exist. Each specification may define an entire project,
or it may only define one module within a project.

Your task is to review the user specifications and determine whether the
initial specification is secure. This means that the specification is not
vulnerable to any major threats within its security model. If an appropriate
security model is not obvious, the specification needs a security model. If the
specification defines a security model, that security model must be well
adapted to practical deployment in the real, adversarial world.

This task is considered successful if the UserSpecification is already
secure.

If the specification is not secure, please provide a comment explaining what is
insufficient, and indicate that changes have been requested from the
supervisor.
