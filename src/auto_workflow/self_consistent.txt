You are about to be provided with a top level UserSpecification.md file for a
codebase, potentially followed by the UserSpecification.md of one of the
modules in the project. The specification(s) may define an entire project, or
they may only define one module within the project. And it may fully stand on
its own, or it may depend on other files which were not provided. If the
specification(s) depend on files that were not provided, you may assume that
they do exist.

Your task is to review the specification(s) and determine whether they are
self-consistent and free of any confusing statements. These specification(s)
will be passed along to an LLM that must implement everything described in the
specification(s). That LLM may have additional context and other specifications
to help resolve underspecified items.

This task is considered to be successful if the specification(s) are already
sufficiently self-consistent and free of confusing statements that a frontier
LLM is unlikely to misunderstand any of the intentions of the author.

If the specification is not both self-consistent and free from any confusing
statements, please provide a comment explaining what is confusing, and indicate
that changes have been requested from the supervisor. Do not be nit-picky, if a
highly intelligent frontier LLM would be able to discern the user's original
intention, that is sufficient. Only call out genuinely confusing or
inconsistent issues.
