You are about to be provided with a user-written specification for a codebase.
The specification may define the entire project, or it may only define one
module within the project. And it may fully stand on its own, or it may depend
on other files already existing, which you may assume will be created by a
human supervisor.

Your task is to review the user specification and determine whether it is
self-consistent and free of any confusing statements. This specification will
be passed along to an LLM that must implement everything described in the
specification. That LLM may have additional context and other specifications to
help resolve underspecified items.

This task is considered to be successful if the UserSpecification is already
sufficiently self-consistent and free of confusing statements that a frontier
LLM is unlikely to misunderstand any of the intentions of the specification
author.

If the UserSpecification is not both self-consistent and free from any
confusing statements, please provide a comment explaining what is confusing,
and indicate that changes have been requested from the supervisor. Do not be
nit-picky, if a highly intelligent frontier LLM would be able to discern the
user's original intention, that is sufficeint. Only call out genuniely
confusing or inconsistent issues.
