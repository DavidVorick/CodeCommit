## Logging

Each call to an agentic workflow creates its own folder in the
agent-config/logs/ directory that logs all of the activity performed by that
agentic workflow. The folder for the workflow will be "[date]-[workflow]" using
the yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss date format. For example, a logging folder might be
named "2025-09-23-19-51-35-committing-code". The API of the logger structurally
enforces that this format is followed.

The logging module takes care of creating the logging folder, and then other
parts of the codebase declare which files they would like to log to within the
folder, and what data they would like to log.
