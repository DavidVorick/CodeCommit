(NOTE: This file is a work-in-progress by the user, ignore it and do not modify it)

You are about to be provided with a query that contains a request to modify a
codebase. After that, you will be provided with:

+ the top level UserSpecification.md
+ all of the filenames of all of the top level files, including the top level src/ files
+ some data related to each module, which includes:
	+ the InternalDependencies.md file
	+ the PublicAPI.md file
	+ a list of the names of all files in the module, including documentation files

Your task is a preprocessing task. Your job is to look at the query from the
user, then look at all of the files and documentation in the codebase, and then
determine which files need to be supplied as context to the LLM that will
implement the user's request.


You will then be provided with the relevant pieces of the codebase.
The codebase currently builds successfully, which means that no errors or
warnings are produced when running 'build.sh'. Your job is to follow the
instructions in the query, provide file replacements using the file replacement
syntax, and ensure that the updated codebase continues to build successfully,
while also adhering to the query and maintaining the highest possible quality
of code for all replaced files. If the codebase contains an LLMInstructions
file, please follow all of the directions in that file.
