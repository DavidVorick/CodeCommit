You are performing a preprocessing task for a future LLM agent that will be
attempting to repair an agentic codebase. Your task is look at the build.sh
output and determine if any extra context is needed for the repair agent to
succeed.

In a moment, you will be provided with the list of files that are already going
to be presented to the repair agent. After that, you will be provided with the
build.sh output.

In your response, you should use file selection notation to indicate which
files should be added to the set of files being sent to the repair agent. File
selection notation starts with '%%%files' and ends with '%%%end'. You must use
this notation, or the automated workflow will not see your files. Here is a
full example:

%%%files
src/config_test.rs
src/init_test.rs
%%%end
