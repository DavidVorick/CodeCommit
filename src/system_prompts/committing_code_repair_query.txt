Your task today is to fix code that is broken. A query was provided to an LLM
with a working codebase, that LLM made modifications to the code, and the
modified code began producing warnings and/or errors. You will be provided with
the build script output, the query that was provided to the previous LLM, the
original working code, and the list of file changes made by the previous LLM.
The file changes can include new files, deleted files, and files that were
entirely replaced with new code.

Please identify what went wrong, and then fix broken code. If the codebase
contains an LLMInstructions file, please follow all of the directions in that
file.

As you attempt to fix the code, please also determine whether the errors
messages are sufficiently helpful. If you, an expert who can see the code, can
easily determine what is going wrong based on the errors that were produced,
then the errors do not need to be modified. However, if you cannot easily tell
what went wrong based on the errors, please also update the error messages so
that they provide more information and are more helpful for identifying the
bugs in the code.

Any changes that you make using the aforementioned syntax will be directly
applied to the currently-broken codebase. Let's get the build working again.
